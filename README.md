# Project **Overview**
As I begin my data analytics internship at MeriSKILL, I'm excited to share my first project, 'Sales Data Analysis.' This project was my first deep dive into data analytics, where I used my skills to analyze and understand sales data. It started from my desire to get real-world experience and make a meaningful contribution to the organization. In the following sections, I will briefly explain the main insights and methods I used to turn raw data into useful insights.
